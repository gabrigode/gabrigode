### Who? ðŸ‘‹

Hey! I'm Gabriel, a Computer Science Student from Brazil, currently trying to get good at programming while having some fun. I'm a otaku and really like [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/gabrigode) & [manga](https://myanimelist.net/mangalist/gabrigode) but also games - Especially RPGs and hack 'n' slash.
